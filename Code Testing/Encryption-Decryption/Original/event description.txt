Meet the stars of NSU's most recent ICPC pursuit, where they reached the stage of dreams: the World Finals. Learn from their stories, and bootstrap your own journey. 


For the uninitiated, the ICPC website says the following about the competition: "The International Collegiate Programming Contest is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world."


To even reach the highly famed World Finals round of ICPC is a feat held in high esteem across the globe. Our now-alumni Salman Sahel, Akash Lanard, and Mehran Siddiqui of the team "NSU_Stolichnaya" achieved just that with their performance in the 2020 ICPC Asia Dhaka Regional Contest. They then went on to deliver another commendable performance at the World Finals held in Dhaka last month, solving two problems and finishing above some of the world's most reputed universities.


The speakers of this event are these three brilliant members currently working as software engineers at different places. Back in their student days, they used to be members of the NSU Problem Solvers community, regularly contesting in the sport of competitive programming. We will also have Ms. Silvia Ahmed, Senior Lecturer of NSU and the faculty advisor of NSU Problem Solvers, whose unwavering support for the community has long been essential to whatever success it could find.
